# user stories: Project 2 User Stories


# As a coworker, I would like to be able to search for GIFs, so that I can attach them to my emails.

# As an avid GIF user, I would like to be able to select the number of GIFs that appear when I search, so that I don’t get too many results.

# As a developer, I would like to use Giphys API, so that I don’t have to compile all these GIFs on my own.
